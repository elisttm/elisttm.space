	<h1>eli bot</h1>

	<p>this is my silly and moderately useful discord bot with some moderately useful functions</p>
	<p>this page is currently in a limbo in being updated cuz while the bot is still functional and consistently online ive not the drive to develop it further, primarily due to the forthcoming restrictions being put in place by discord for bot developers</p>
