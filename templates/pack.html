	<h1>eli pack</h1>

	<p>
		this is my texture pack ive been maintaining on and off since 2018. its a combination of assets i made and some i stole from other packs i like.
		<br>the pack is designed first and foremost for the latest version of minecraft, but i have versions made specifically for pre 1.9 minecraft (labeled as "legacy")
